Strongly composite numners:
1. strongly composite numbers is a subset of composite numbers
2. They should have number of prime factors less than or equal to the number of composite factors

Examples:
Strongly composite numbers:
3 (prime number): 1, 3
9 (square of a prime number): 1, 3, 9
15 (product of 2 unique prime numbers): 1, 3, 5, 15

Conditions:
1. Product pi(B) = pi(A)
2. len(B) is maximum
3. All bi are strongly composite and greater than 1.

Observations:
1. Stricly composite numbers are either squares of primes or products of 2 distinct primes.

Strategy to get array B from A:


We can define prime power as the sum of powers of prime numbers after prime factorization.

a. If the prime power = 0, num = 1
b. pp == 1, num is prime
c. pp == 2, num is strongly composite
d. pp > 2, num is a non strong composite number

Input may contain all 4 cases. In any case we have to populate the array with a product of 2 primes (same will create square, otherwise it is still stonngly composite)


If the sum of pp of elements of A is odd, then we cannot construct B.
